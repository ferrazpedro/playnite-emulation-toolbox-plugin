# playnite-emulation-toolbox-plugin
A plugin to manage some emulated games metadata in Playnite.

Right now it can alter 3 things:

1 - Rename your PlayAction as the same as your game name.

2 - Clean your ROMs entries names so they "fit" with your PlayAction name when you have multiple ROMs.

3 - Change all hyphens ( - ) to colons (: ). 

4 - Merge emulated games.

The idea is to slowly add more functions that I feel are needed to organize emulated games in Playnite.
