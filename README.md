# playnite-emulation-toolbox-plugin
A plugin to manage some emulated games metadata in Playnite.

Right now it can alter these things (they only work with emulated games):

1 - Rename your PlayAction as the same as your game name.

2 - Clean your ROMs entries names so they "fit" with your PlayAction name when you have multiple ROMs.

3 - Change all hyphens ( - ) to colons (: ). 

4 - Merge emulated games.

5 - Remove "The" from the middle of a game name and add it back in the beginning.

6 - Add a sorting name to games that start with "The" without it.

The idea is to slowly add more functions that I feel are needed to organize emulated games in Playnite.
